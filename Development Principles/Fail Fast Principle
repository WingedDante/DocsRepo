# The fail fast principle
[Source](https://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/2015/09/15/fail-fast-principle/)

The fail fast principle stands for stopping the current operation as soon as any unexpected error occurs. Adhering to this principle generally results in a more stable solution. It might appear counter-intuitive at first. How is it so that failing at any error leads to stability? Isn’t it backward?

Indeed, when you start applying this practice, application crashes might seem overwhelming, especially if you have a working software whose developers didn’t stick to fail-fast before. But if you don’t give up, grit your teeth and fix all the code causing those failures, you will benefit from it greatly.
