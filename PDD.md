#Pain Driven Development (PDD)

## Making decisions at the last responsible moment by encouraging our team to ‘feel the pain’ before introducing any constraint in our application

* YAGNI (You aren't going to need it), if we don't have a  problem now, we don't need a solution now, so we probably won't need a solution in the future either.  "What if" questions a lot of the time hit on YAGNI.
* Wait until there's development pain before we accept a problem as an issue
*  Do the _simplest_ thing to solve the problem
* Wait until you feel more pain before we try anything else in that space (ie. for that problem).
